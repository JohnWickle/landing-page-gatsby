  Gatsby Starter Landing Page
</h1>

**This is a work-in-progress and not ready for general use**

Create custom landing pages using Gatsby and Contentful with this starter-theme combo.
This starter demonstrates how to use Contentful to build dynamic and customizable landing pages with Gatsby and can serve as a starting-point for creating your own custom landing page components that match your visual brand.

## Quick start

1. **Create a Gatsby site**

   Use the Gatsby CLI to get started locally:

   ```sh
   npx gatsby new my-landing-page-site https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-landing-page
   ```

2. **Configure your Contentful space**

   Create a new Contentful space or use an existing one, then upload the `data/sample-data.json` file to your space.

3. **Add environment variables**

   Create a `.env` file in the root directory of your site and add the following environment variables. You can copy the `.env.example` file provided. Find the values for these keys in the Contentful web app under _Settings > API Keys_.

   ```sh
   CONTENTFUL_SPACE_ID="<YOUR_SPACE_ID>"
   CONTENTFUL_DELIVERY_ACCESS_TOKEN="<ACCESS_TOKEN>"
   ```

4. **Start developing**

   Navigate to your new site's directory and start the development server.
   **Note:** this starter uses Yarn Workspaces and requires Yarn for development.

   ```sh
   cs my-landing-page-site
   yarn && yarn start
   ```

5. **Open the source code and start editing!**

   Your site should now be running at <http://localhost:8000>
